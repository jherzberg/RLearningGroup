## Welcome to the ChiHackNight R Learning Group!

Please read to quick start! Each week we read one chapter and then discuss it on Tuesday. You can catch up quickly by reading below and following the exercises. If you want to study the material more closely, please read any chapters you have missed. Feel free to contact me, jlherzberg, on slack with questions.

We are using this [textbook](https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/attach/ighbo26t3ua52t/igp9099yy4v10/igz7vp4w5su9/OReilly_HandsOn_Programming_with_R_2014.pdf).

### Chapter 0
You don't need to download R to participate in the weekly discussion. You do need to download R and RStudio to code on your own. Please watch this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cX532N_XLIs) to download R and RStudio.

### Chapter 1
1. Add `6` and `10` together with R.
2. Set the object `x` equal to 8.

5. Compute the `mean` of `5` and `8`.
6. Write a comment with `#`.
7. Write a function that rolls two dice with the `sample` function and returns their `sum`.
