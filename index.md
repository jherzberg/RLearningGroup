## Welcome to!

Read this page to join our group! Each week we read one textbook chapter and then discuss it on Tuesday. You can catch up quickly by reading this page and following the exercises. If you want to study the material more closely, please read any chapters you missed. Feel free to contact me, JLHerzberg, on slack with questions.

We are using this [textbook](https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/attach/ighbo26t3ua52t/igp9099yy4v10/igz7vp4w5su9/OReilly_HandsOn_Programming_with_R_2014.pdf).

### Chapter 0
You don't need to download R to participate in the weekly discussion. You do need to download R and RStudio to code on your own. Please watch this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cX532N_XLIs) to download R and RStudio.

### Chapter 1
1. Add `6` and `10` together with R.
2. Set the object `x` equal to 8.
3. Set the object `die` equal to the range of numbers `1` through `6`.
4. Compare `die` to the range numbers `5` through `6`. 
5. Compute the `mean` of `5` and `8`.
6. Write a comment with `#`.
7. Write a function that rolls two dice with the `sample` function and returns their `sum`.
8. Rewrite that function with an argument parameter for the number of dice to roll.
